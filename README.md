# CloudCostly ☁️

CloudCostly is a beginner-friendly WordPress project built to explore how custom themes, plugins, and frontend styling work together within the WordPress ecosystem. This project reflects hands-on learning with WordPress development fundamentals rather than a production-ready application.

CloudCostly was created to understand the structure of WordPress projects, how plugins extend functionality, and how CSS is applied and managed within WordPress themes.

## Overview 🚀

The primary objective of this project was to gain practical experience with:
- Custom WordPress plugin development
- Theme and file structure in WordPress
- Enqueuing assets (CSS) correctly using WordPress hooks
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

While the project includes frontend styling, achieving precise color consistency with CSS was challenging. This helped highlight real-world issues such as CSS specificity, caching, and WordPress’s style-loading behavior, which are areas I am actively improving.

## Styling Note 🎨

The CSS structure is present in this project; however, the final color output does not fully match the intended design. This was part of the learning process and helped me better understand how WordPress handles styles, overrides, and browser caching. Improving the UI and refining the CSS is planned as a future enhancement.

## Learning Focus 🌱

This project represents my early-stage learning in WordPress development. The emphasis was on understanding concepts, debugging issues, and gaining practical exposure rather than delivering a visually perfect interface.

---

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Refine CSS styling and color consistency
- Improve UI/UX
- Clean up frontend structure
- Add deployment and automation workflows
